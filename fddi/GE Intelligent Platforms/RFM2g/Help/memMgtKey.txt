Registry Modification of "SystemPages" value

Windows  XP and Server 2003 manages page tables by 
calculating the number of Page Table Entries (PTE's) to allocate. 
When NT was developed, it was not considered that a hardware system could 
have devices (such as Reflective Memory or large memory graphic cards) could 
have more peripheral memory that system memory.
 
This problem is solved by changing the number of PTE to allocate. The 
Windows OS looks for the "SystemPages" in the registry for the value.

Change the registry on XP to allow the 2Gigabit 
RFM driver (pmc55xx.sys) to load and start.

Please be sure to back up your system and create an
emergency repair disk before editing the registry.
If you incorrectly modify the registry, then Windows
may become nonfunctional on your computer. 
 
1.  Select "Run..." from the "Start" menu.

2.  Type "regedit.exe" and press "Enter" to start the
    "Registry Editor". You must have Administrator privledges to
    save changes made in the registry.
            
3.  Find the following registry key:
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\
        Session Manager\Memory Management]

4.  Modify the "SystemPages" registry value.  
    The maximum amount for Windows XP and Server 2003 
    the max value is 0xffffffff.  
    Please make a note of the original
    value in case you want to restore it later.

5.  Reboot the computer when finished, restart Windows,
    and then run the "RFM2g Command Line Interpreter" to
    see if the "Cannot open RFM file (\\.\rfm2g1)!" dialog
    message is displayed.
                
    If the RFM card still cannot be opened, then
    repeat the previous steps and increase the "SystemPages"
    registry value.  Please be advised that by using a
                larger value, more system resources (i.e. memory) are
                being used.  


Change using the following
formula:

SystemPages =	 20,000   for the firest 32 Megabytes in a system of Main memory
		  8,192   for each addtional 32 Megabytes of Main memory 		
                  8,192   for each 32 Megabytes of Reflective Memory
