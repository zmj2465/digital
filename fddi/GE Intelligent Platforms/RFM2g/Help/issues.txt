Issue #1.
    
    Symptoms:
        A "FATAL ERROR" dialog box is displayed with the message
        "Cannot open RFM file (\\.\rfm2g1)!" when a program, 
        such as the "RFM2g Command Line Interpreter", tries to
        open the "\\.\rfm2g" device.

    Cause:
        This is occurs because the call to the "rfm2gOpen" function
        in the RFM2GDLL_STDC_32/64 Dynamic Link Library (DLL) failed.
        This can occur for several reasons.

    Possible Problems and/or Solutions:
        A.  Power down the system and confirm that the RFM2g
            card is correctly jumpered and  properly inserted
            into an appropriate PCI, CPCI, or PMC slot.
            Please refer to the RFM Product Manual that came
            with the RFM card for more specifics.

        B.  In Windows, verify that all previous versions
            of the RFM Device Drivers are uninstalled from
            the system by using "Add/Remove Programs" in
            the "Control Panel".
           
            As a safety check, you can also search the system for
            files named "PMC55xx.SYS/pmc5565.sys", and
            "RFM2gDLL_STDC.DLL".  Remove any copies of these
            files that are found.
 
            Reboot the system when finished to allow the
            uninstall program to clean up after itself,
            then install the new version of the RFM drivers.
        
        C.  The Windows system may be running out of page table 
	    entries (PTEs).
            PTEs are used to map the memory on the RFM card into
            the virtual address space of the Windows kernel.
            If there are not enough PTEs available, then the
            RFM card cannot be opened.  The number of available
            PTEs can be increased by modifying the "SystemPages"
            registry value under the registry key:

		[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management]  

	    and then rebooting
            the system.  For more detailed instructions follow
            the directions below.

            ** WARNING **   
 
	    Please be sure to back up your system and create an
            emergency repair disk before editing the registry.
            If you incorrectly modify the registry, then Windows
            may become nonfunctional on your computer. 

            1.  Select "Run..." from the "Start" menu.
            2.  Type "regedit.exe" and press "Enter" to start the
                "Registry Editor".
            3.  Find the following registry key with the "Registry Editor":
		  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\
                      Session Manager\Memory Management]
            4.  Modify the "SystemPages" registry value.  For Older 
		Systems, Recommended values to try are between 20000 and 50000 decimal.
                Try using a lower value (i.e. 20000) intially.Please make 
		a note of the original value in case you want to restore it later.
            5.  Reboot the computer when finished, restart Windows,
                and then run the "RFM Command Line Interpreter" to
                see if the "Cannot open RFM file (\\.\rfm2g1)!" dialog
                message is displayed.
                
                If the RFM card still cannot be opened, then
                repeat the previous steps and increase the "SystemPages"
                registry value.  Please be advised that by using a
                larger value, more system resources (i.e. memory) are
                being used.  

        D.  If you have tried steps A, B, and C above and are
            still having problems, then the RFM card may not
            be functioning correctly.  Please contact GE Intelligent Platforms Embedded Systems, Inc
            for further assistance.
